Classifying Malware Using Dynamic Analysis and Profile Hidden Markov Models
=======

# Abstract
Malicious software, also know as malware, is a persistent threat to the security
of informa- tion systems. The continuous development of new exploits, attack
methods and malware samples creates a need for security analysts to stay up to
date with current threats. To aid in this task, tools such as dynamic analysis
systems are used to extract informa- tion from malware samples. However, the
volume of information extracted by such tools may be too large for manual
analysis or inspection. In this work, we use Profile Hidden Markov Models to
create statistical models using supervised learning. The models are generated by
applying Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm to the sequence of actions
executed by the malware sample inside a dynamic analysis environment. A total of
606 malware samples were used, which we split into 301 for training the models
and 305 for testing these created models. Those classification models allow the
labeling of unknown samples, as well as uncovering information regarding malware
oper- ation. When tested, the models performed well, since they obtained high
F-Scores. We were also able to identify similar behavior among different malware
families by comparing the labeling results present in the confusion matrix. The
results obtained indicate that further research in this area can provide
promising insights for defense against malware attacks.
